I hold a Master's degree in Economics from Universidad de los Andes. My thesis, titled <a href='https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/handle/1992/58861'>"Perreology: Leveraging Music in Statistical Analysis"</a>, utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to derive vector representations of music. This methodology informed the development of two applications. The first predicts the likelihood of a song ranking among the top 50 tracks in Colombia with a recall of 69%. The second application shows that the musical embeddings of the monthly top 50 songs in Colombia can explain up to 82% of the variability in the Consumer Confidence Index.

A demo of the predictive application is available <a href='https://perreologia.quantil.co/'>here</a>.

I currently serve as an Adjunct Professor at Universidad de los Andes, offering courses on machine learning and game theory. Additionally, I hold the position of Deputy Director of the Data Mining Department at <a href='https://quantil.co/en'>Quantil</a>.
