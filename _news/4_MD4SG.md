The <a href="https://www.md4sg.com/workinggroups/projects/rednacecyt">Summer of Science Program</a> aims to empower female students from indigenous communities in Mexico, assisting them in designing and executing research projects to benefit their local communities. This year, I had the privilege of collaborating with Anai Domingo Martínez, an indigenous woman from the Tének community. We worked on the project titled **"An met'antalab, ¿jant'ey a exlal?: An Evaluation of an Educational Intervention for Indigenous Adolescents on Knowledge about the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)."**

Anai's initiative centered on an educational intervention, conducted in the Tének language, to spread awareness about HPV at a public high school in San Antonio, San Luis Potosí. The outcomes of this intervention were showcased in a poster presentation at <a href="https://eaamo.org/">EAAMO '23</a>.
