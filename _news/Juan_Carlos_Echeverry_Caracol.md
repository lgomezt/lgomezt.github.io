# Impact of the 'Modelling Underreported Spatio-Temporal Crime Events' Research on the National Security Debate

***

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Echeverry_(politician)">Juan Carlos Echeverry</a> , former Minister of Finance and former President of Ecopetrol, was interviewed on July 26, 2023, on Caracol Radio, one of the most renowned communication platforms in Colombia, to discuss the crime situation in Bogotá from an academic perspective.

During the interview, Juan Carlos refers to our article <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287776">Modelling Underreported Spatio-Temporal Crime Events</a>, using it as a basis to discuss our estimation of the "dark figure of crime," which reflects the actual number of violent crimes in Bogotá. Thanks to this research, it was determined that, for the year 2018, the underreporting of violent crimes in the city was approximately 40%. This suggests that there were around 10 thousand crimes that went unreported.
