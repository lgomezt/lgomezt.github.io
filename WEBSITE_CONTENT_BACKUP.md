## About / Bio

I hold a Master's degree in Economics from Universidad de los Andes. My thesis, titled ["Perreology: Leveraging Music in Statistical Analysis"](https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/handle/1992/58861), utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to derive vector representations of music. This methodology informed the development of two applications. The first predicts the likelihood of a song ranking among the top 50 tracks in Colombia with a recall of 69%. The second application shows that the musical embeddings of the monthly top 50 songs in Colombia can explain up to 82% of the variability in the Consumer Confidence Index.

A demo of the predictive application is available [here](https://perreologia.quantil.co/).

I currently serve as an Adjunct Professor at Universidad de los Andes, offering courses on machine learning and game theory. Additionally, I hold the position of Deputy Director of the Data Mining Department at [Quantil](https://quantil.co/en).

### Selected Publications

#### 1. Modelling underreported spatio-temporal crime events (2023)
- **Authors:** Riascos Villegas, Álvaro J., Ñungo, Jose Sebastian, Gómez Tobón, Lucas, Dulce Rubio, Mateo, Gómez, Francisco
- **Journal:** PLOS ONE, Volume 18, Number 7
- **DOI:** 10.1371/journal.pone.0287776
- **Abstract:** Crime observations are one of the principal inputs used by governments for designing citizens' security strategies. However, crime measurements are obscured by underreporting biases, resulting in the so-called "dark figure of crime". This work studies the possibility of recovering "true" crime and underreported incident rates over time using sequentially available daily data. For this, a novel underreporting model of spatiotemporal events based on the combinatorial multi-armed bandit framework was proposed. Through extensive simulations, the proposed methodology was validated for identifying the fundamental parameters of the proposed model: the "true" rates of incidence and underreporting of events. Once the proposed model was validated, crime data from a large city, Bogotá (Colombia), was used to estimate the "true" crime and underreporting rates. Our results suggest that this methodology could be used to rapidly estimate the underreporting rates of spatiotemporal events, which is a critical problem in public policy design.

## News / Announcements

### 1. Juan Carlos Echeverry, former Minister of Finance and former President of Ecopetrol, discussed our research 'Modelling Underreported Spatio-Temporal Crime Events' on Caracol Radio
**Date:** July 26, 2023

**Content:**
Juan Carlos Echeverry, former Minister of Finance and former President of Ecopetrol, was interviewed on July 26, 2023, on Caracol Radio, one of the most renowned communication platforms in Colombia, to discuss the crime situation in Bogotá from an academic perspective.

During the interview, Juan Carlos refers to our article [Modelling Underreported Spatio-Temporal Crime Events](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287776), using it as a basis to discuss our estimation of the "dark figure of crime," which reflects the actual number of violent crimes in Bogotá. Thanks to this research, it was determined that, for the year 2018, the underreporting of violent crimes in the city was approximately 40%. This suggests that there were around 10 thousand crimes that went unreported.

### 4. REDNACECYT-MD4SG 2023 Summer of Science Program
**Date:** October 31, 2023

**Title:** Mentored an educational intervention in a Mexican indigenous community as part of the REDNACECYT-MD4SG Summer of Science program

**Content:**
The [Summer of Science Program](https://www.md4sg.com/workinggroups/projects/rednacecyt) aims to empower female students from indigenous communities in Mexico, assisting them in designing and executing research projects to benefit their local communities. This year, I had the privilege of collaborating with Anai Domingo Martínez, an indigenous woman from the Tének community. We worked on the project titled **"An met'antalab, ¿jant'ey a exlal?: An Evaluation of an Educational Intervention for Indigenous Adolescents on Knowledge about the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)."**

Anai's initiative centered on an educational intervention, conducted in the Tének language, to spread awareness about HPV at a public high school in San Antonio, San Luis Potosí. The outcomes of this intervention were showcased in a poster presentation at [EAAMO '23](https://eaamo.org/).
